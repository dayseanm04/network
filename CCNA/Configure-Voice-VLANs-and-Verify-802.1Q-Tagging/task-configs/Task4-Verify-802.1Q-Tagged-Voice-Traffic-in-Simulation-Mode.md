# 📞 Task 4 – Verify 802.1Q-Tagged Voice Traffic in Simulation Mode (PH1 ➜ PH2)

## 📌 Objective

Use **Packet Tracer Simulation Mode** to verify whether **voice traffic** (IP phone call) is **tagged with a VLAN ID**.

✅ I will:

- Call from **PH1 to PH2**
- Inspect the **first voice-related frame**
- Confirm that the traffic is **802.1Q tagged** for the **Voice VLAN**

---

## 🧠 What I am Testing (Simple)

Voice VLANs are designed so the **phone sends tagged traffic**, even though it’s connected to an access port.

📌 Expectation:

- **Voice traffic = tagged (802.1Q / Dot1Q)**
- **VLAN ID = 20** (Voice VLAN)

## ☎️ Phone Info

| Device | Extension |
|--------|----------|
| PH1 | 2020 |
| PH2 | 2010 |

## 🧪 Simulation Steps

### 1️⃣ Switch to Simulation Mode

- At the bottom right, click **Simulation** (instead of Realtime)

---

### 2️⃣ Open PH1 Dial Pad

On **PH1**:
- Click the phone
- Go to the **GUI**
- Dial **2010** (PH2)

---

### 3️⃣ Watch the Packets Appear
- You should see call signaling traffic (often **SCCP** in Packet Tracer)
- Click the **first frame** generated for the call

---

### 4️⃣ Inspect the Frame Details

- Click **Outbound PDU Details**
- Look for **Dot1Q / 802.1Q tagging**

## ✅ What to Look For

### 🔍 Confirm VLAN Tagging

In the details, verify you see indicators like:

- **Dot1Q**
- **802.1Q tag**

**✅ Expected result:**

- The voice traffic is **tagged**
- The tag shows it belongs to **Voice VLAN 20**

Note that the TCI is **0x0014** 0014 is hexidecimal which is 20 in binary. Voice VLAN in 20

---

## 📝 Answer

### ❓ Is the traffic tagged with a VLAN ID?

**✅ Yes**  voice traffic is **802.1Q tagged** and should show **VLAN 20**.
