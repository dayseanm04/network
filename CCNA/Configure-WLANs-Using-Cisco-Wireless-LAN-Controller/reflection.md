# 🧠 Reflection – Configure WLANs Using Cisco Wireless LAN Controller

## 📌 Summary

In this lab, I configured a wireless network using a **Cisco 3504 Wireless Controller**. I accessed the WLC GUI, created **dynamic interfaces**, configured **Internal and Guest WLANs**, secured them with **WPA2-PSK**, and verified connectivity by associating a wireless client to an access point.

The lab helped me understand how wireless networks are **centrally managed** using a controller instead of configuring each access point individually.
