# ðŸ§© Multilayer Switching Lab

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This lab focuses on configuring **inter-VLAN routing using a multilayer switch** instead of the Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) configuration. It builds on the previous **VLAN-Router-on-a-Stick Lab** configuration, replacing the router subinterfaces with a **Layer 3 point-to-point connection** between **R1** and **SW2**.  

By the end of this lab, the network will have **full inter-VLAN connectivity** and **Internet access** through the Multilayer Switch.
