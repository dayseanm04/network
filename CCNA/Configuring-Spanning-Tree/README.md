# 🧠 Configuring STP (PVST+)

This lab focuses on understanding and configuring **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** using **Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+)** on Cisco switches. The objective is to verify the STP topology, configure root bridges for different VLANs, manipulate STP parameters like cost and port priority, and enable **PortFast** and **BPDU Guard** for network stability and security.
