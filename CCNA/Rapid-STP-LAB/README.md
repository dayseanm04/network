# 🌐 Rapid-STP Lab

The lab focuses on identifying the root bridge, analyzing port roles, calculating root costs, and configuring RSTP link types across a multi-switch topology.

# 📘 Overview

- Understand how RSTP selects the root bridge.
- Analyze RSTP port roles and states.
- Calculate root path costs between switches.
- Configure RSTP link types (point-to-point, shared, edge).
- Observe how hubs affect collision domains.
- Verify all results using the CLI (show spanning-tree).

## 🧰 Devices Used
- 4 Cisco 2960-24TT switches
- 2 Hubs
- 5 PCs (PC1–PC5)

# 🧪 Tasks (Summary)

# Task 1: Identify the Root Bridge
- Determine which switch becomes the root bridge.
- Examine port roles/states on the root switch.
