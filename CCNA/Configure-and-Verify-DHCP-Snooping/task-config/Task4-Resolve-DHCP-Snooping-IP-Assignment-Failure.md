# 🛠️ Task 4 – Fix DHCP Snooping Option 82 Issue

## 📌 Objective
Fix the DHCP Snooping issue that prevents **PC1** from receiving an IP address.

In this lab, the DHCP request fails because **Option 82** (DHCP relay information) was added and the DHCP message that is why it got **dropped**.

✅ I will disable the DHCP Snooping information option and then retest DHCP.

---

## 🧠 Simple Explanation

- Some switches add **Option 82** to DHCP messages
- In this setup, that causes the DHCP message to be **dropped**
- The fix is to stop the switches from adding that option
