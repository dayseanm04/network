# Configuring HSRP Lab 🔁🛡️

## 📌 Summary
This lab focuses on configuring and testing **HSRPv2 (Hot Standby Router Protocol)** to provide **default gateway redundancy** for end devices.  
You will verify connectivity, configure HSRP priorities and preemption, test failover behavior, and observe how the virtual IP (VIP) and virtual MAC address behave during router failures and recovery.
