# 📝 Reflection – Configuring SNMP Lab

## 📘 Lab Summary
- In this lab, I configured **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** on a router and used a **MIB Browser** to monitor and manage the device remotely.
- I created both **read-only** and **read/write** SNMP communities on **R1**.
- Using **SNMP Get** messages, I gathered important information about the router.
- Using an **SNMP Set** message, I remotely changed the hostname of R1.
- This lab showed how SNMP is used for both **monitoring** and **management**.
