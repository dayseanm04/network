## 📝 Summary
In this lab, I worked on troubleshooting and fixing OSPF issues in a partially pre-configured network.  
Instead of building everything from scratch, the focus was on identifying problems, understanding why they occurred, and applying the correct fixes.  
The lab involved configuring a new serial link, resolving missing routes, fixing OSPF neighbor adjacencies, restoring external connectivity, and examining the OSPF Link-State Database (LSDB).
