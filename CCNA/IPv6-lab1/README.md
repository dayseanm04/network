# 🌐 IPv6 Configuration Lab

## 🧩 Overview
In this lab, I created a **dual-stack environment** where both IPv4 and IPv6 operate simultaneously. This allows devices to communicate using either protocol, ensuring compatibility with both legacy and modern networks.

The lab focuses on enabling IPv6 routing on the router, assigning IPv6 addresses to interfaces and PCs, and verifying connectivity through ping tests.

## 🧠 Objectives
1. Enable IPv6 routing on the router (R1).  
2. Configure appropriate IPv6 addresses on all router interfaces.  
3. Verify IPv6 configuration and confirm the addresses on each interface.  
4. Configure IPv6 addresses and default gateways on all PCs.  
5. Test IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity between all devices using both IPv4 and IPv6.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
1. Enabled IPv6 routing on the router to support IPv6 traffic.  
2. Configured unique IPv6 addresses for each router interface corresponding to separate VLANs or networks.  
3. Verified IPv6 configuration on the router and confirmed addresses on all interfaces.  
4. Assigned IPv6 addresses and default gateways to all connected PCs.  
5. Performed ping tests between PCs to verify IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.
