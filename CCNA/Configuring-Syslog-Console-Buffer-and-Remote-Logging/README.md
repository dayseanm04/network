# 📟 Configuring Syslog — Console, Buffer, and Remote Logging Lab

## 📌 Lab Overview
In this lab, I configured **Syslog logging** on a Cisco router to observe how system messages are generated, categorized, and delivered to different logging destinations.  
The lab focuses on **console logging**, **VTY logging**, **buffered logging**, and **remote syslog server logging**, which are essential for **monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing network devices**.

This lab demonstrates how syslog messages behave differently depending on the connection method and logging configuration.
