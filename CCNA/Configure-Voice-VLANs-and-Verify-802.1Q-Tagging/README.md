# 📞 Configure Voice VLANs and Verify 802.1Q Tagging

## 📌 Summary

This lab demonstrates how **voice and data traffic are separated using VLANs** and how **802.1Q tagging behaves differently** for PCs and IP phones.

A **Voice VLAN** is configured on access switch ports so that:

- **Data traffic (PCs)** remains **untagged**
- **Voice traffic (IP Phones)** is **tagged with 802.1Q**

Packet Tracer **Simulation Mode** is used to visually verify this behavior.
