# HSRP Refletion

## 📝 Summary
In this lab, I configured and tested **HSRPv2** to provide default gateway redundancy for end devices.  
The lab focused on verifying connectivity, implementing HSRP with priorities and preemption, configuring a virtual IP (VIP) as the default gateway, and testing failover and recovery behavior.  
By simulating router failures and recoveries, I was able to observe how HSRP maintains network availability.
