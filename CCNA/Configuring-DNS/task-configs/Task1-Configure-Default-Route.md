# 🌍 Task 1 – Configure Default Route on R1

## 🎯 Goal
Configure a **default route** on **R1** so it can reach the **Internet**.  
This step is required for **DNS resolution and external connectivity** to work in later tasks.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
- DNS servers (like `1.1.1.1`) are **outside** the local network
- Without a default route, R1 **does not know where to send Internet traffic**
