# 📞 Task 4 – Verify 802.1Q-Tagged Voice Traffic in Simulation Mode (PH1 ➜ PH2)

## 📌 Objective

Use **Packet Tracer Simulation Mode** to verify whether **voice traffic** (IP phone call) is **tagged with a VLAN ID**.

✅ I will:

- Call from **PH1 to PH2**
- Inspect the **first voice-related frame**
- Confirm that the traffic is **802.1Q tagged** for the **Voice VLAN**

---

## 🧠 What I am Testing (Simple)

Voice VLANs are designed so the **phone sends tagged traffic**, even though it’s connected to an access port.

📌 Expectation:

- **Voice traffic = tagged (802.1Q / Dot1Q)**
- **VLAN ID = 20** (Voice VLAN)
