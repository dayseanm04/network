# 🛰️ CDP and LLDP Configuration and Verification LAB

## 📌 Summary
This lab focuses on **network device discovery** using **CDP** and **LLDP**. I will use CDP to identify neighboring devices and fill in missing topology details (IP addresses and interface IDs). Then I will harden the network by disabling CDP where appropriate and enabling LLDP for standardized device discovery.

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

By completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Use **CDP** to discover neighbors and document missing topology details
- Disable CDP on **access ports connected to PCs**
- Disable CDP **globally** on network devices
- Enable **LLDP** globally and enable **Tx/Rx** on the interfaces connected to other network device
- Verify LLDP neighbor relationships

## Topology For Reference
