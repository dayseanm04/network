# 🌐 Configuring Static NAT Lab

## 📘 Lab Overview
In this lab, I configured **Static Network Address Translation (Static NAT)** to allow internal hosts to communicate with the internet using **public IP addresses**. Static NAT creates a **one-to-one mapping** between an inside local address and an inside global address.

The lab demonstrates why NAT is required, how static NAT is configured on a router, and how NAT translations behave when traffic is generated and cleared.
