This lab focuses on building **Layer 2 and Layer 3 EtherChannels** using LACP, PAgP, and Static mode. I also configure routing and adjusted the load-balancing methods across the switches. This helped me understand real-world skills in link aggregation, redundancy, and multi-path efficiency. 🌐🔗


## 📘 Summary

In this lab I:

- Configured layer 2 EtherChannels using **LACP** and **PAgP**
- Configured a Layer 3 EtherChannel between distribution switches
- Configured Static routing to allow end-to-end connectivity
- Configured the Switches etherchannel load-balancing method to **source-and-destination IP**
