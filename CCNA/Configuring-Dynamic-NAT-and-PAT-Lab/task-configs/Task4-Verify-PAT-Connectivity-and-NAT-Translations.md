# 🌐 Task 4 – Verify PAT Connectivity and NAT Translations

## 🎯 Goal
Verify that **PAT (NAT Overload)** is working correctly by testing internet connectivity from **all internal hosts** and examining the **NAT translation table** on R1.

After switching from Dynamic NAT to PAT, **PC1, PC2, and PC3 should all be able to access the internet at the same time** using a single public IP address.
