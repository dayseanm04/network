# 🔁 Configure and Verify HSRP and STP Synchronization

## 📌 Summary

This lab focuses on **synchronizing HSRP and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**.  
The goal is to ensure that the **HSRP active gateway is also the STP root bridge** for each VLAN.

When HSRP and STP are aligned, traffic from end hosts follows the **most direct and efficient path** to the default gateway, improving performance and avoiding unnecessary Layer 2 detours.
