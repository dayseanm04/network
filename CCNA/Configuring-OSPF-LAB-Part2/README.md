# Configuring OSPF – Lab Part 2 🧭🖧

## Summary
This lab focuses on configuring and verifying OSPFv2 across four routers in a single-area design.  
I will configure hostnames, interfaces, loopbacks, OSPF, reference bandwidth, advertise the default route, and examine OSPF Hello messages in Packet Tracer Simulation Mode.  
The tasks listed below come directly from the lab instructions.

## 🗂️ Tasks

### 🧩 Task 1
Configure the appropriate hostnames and IP addresses on each device.  
Enable router interfaces. (ISPR1 does not need configuration)

### 🌐 Task 3
Enable OSPF directly on each router interface.  
Configure passive interfaces as appropriate.

### ⚙️ Task 4
Configure the reference bandwidth so a FastEthernet interface has a cost of 100.

### 🚪 Task 5
Configure R1 as an ASBR that advertises a default route into the OSPF domain.

### 🔍 Task 6
Check the routing table of R4 and identify what default route(s) were added.

### 🛰️ Task 7
Use Simulation Mode to view OSPF Hello messages.  
Identify the fields included in the Hello message.
