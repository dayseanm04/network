# 🧠 Reflection – CDP and LLDP-Configuration and Verification

## 📌 Summary

In this lab, I used **CDP** to discover neighboring devices and document missing topology details like **interfaces and IP addresses**. After understanding the network layout, I disabled CDP on end-host ports and then disabled it globally across all devices. Finally, I enabled **LLDP** and verified neighbors to confirm that device discovery still worked using a vendor-neutral protocol.
