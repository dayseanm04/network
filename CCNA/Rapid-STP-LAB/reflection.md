# Reflection: Rapid-STP Lab 💭

## Overview 📝

This lab helped me understand how Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)
makes decisions in a real switching environment. By working through
each task, I gained hands-on experience with port roles, link types,
root path cost calculations, and how hubs affect the topology.
