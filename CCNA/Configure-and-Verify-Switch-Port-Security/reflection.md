# 🧠 Reflection – Configure and Verify Switch Port Security

## 📌 Lab Summary

In this lab, I configured and tested **switch port security** to control which devices are allowed to access the network at **Layer 2**. Different port security policies were applied on two switches to compare how **shutdown** and **restrict** violation modes behave in real scenarios.

By intentionally triggering violations, I was able to observe how switches detect unauthorized MAC addresses and enforce security rules on both **access ports** and **trunk ports**.
