# 🔐 Task 4 — Configure R1 as NTP Master (Stratum 8) + Authenticate R2/R3 (Includes Task 5)

## 🎯 Goal
Configure **R1** as a **Stratum 8 NTP master**, then synchronize **R2** and **R3** to **R1** using **NTP authentication**.  
Because Packet Tracer does **not support `ntp source`**, use **R1’s physical interface IP addresses** as the NTP server addresses.

✅ **Task 5 is included here:** Configure NTP to update the **hardware calendar** on the routers (note: you can’t view the calendar in Packet Tracer). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
