# 🛠️ Task 1 Configure IP Addressing  and Routing for Full Connectivity

## 📌 Objective

Configure **IP addressing** on all devices and configure **static routing** on the routers so the network has **full end-to-end connectivity**.

This step is required before attempting any **TFTP or FTP file transfers**.

---

## 🧠 Simple Explanation
- All devices must have correct **IP addresses**
- Routers must know how to reach **remote networks**
- File transfers (TFTP/FTP) will **fail** if connectivity is not working
