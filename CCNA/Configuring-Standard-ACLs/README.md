# Configuring Standard ACL Lab 🚦📋

## 📌 Summary
In this lab I will configure **standard Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to control traffic flow between networks.  
You will first configure **OSPF** to ensure full connectivity, then apply **standard numbered ACLs on R1** and **standard named ACLs on R2** to enforce specific network security policies.
