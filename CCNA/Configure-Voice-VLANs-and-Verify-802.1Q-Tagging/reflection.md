# 🧠 Reflection – Configure Voice VLANs and Verify 802.1Q Tagging

## 📌 Lab Summar
y
In this lab, I configured **voice and data VLANs** on an access switch and used **Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS)** to enable inter-VLAN routing. The main goal was to understand how **voice traffic and data traffic behave differently** on a network, especially in terms of **802.1Q VLAN tagging**.

Using **Packet Tracer Simulation Mode**, I verified how traffic is handled at the frame level by inspecting outbound PDUs for both **PC-to-PC** and **IP phone-to-IP phone** communication.
