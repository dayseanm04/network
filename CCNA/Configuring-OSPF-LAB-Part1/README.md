# 🛰️ Configuring OSPF Lab – Part 1

This lab focuses on building an OSPF network using four routers. I will configure OSPF on the routers, loopback interfaces, passive interfaces, configure a default route on R1. The goal is to understand how OSPF neighbors form, how networks are advertised, and how default routes propagate through the OSPF domain.
