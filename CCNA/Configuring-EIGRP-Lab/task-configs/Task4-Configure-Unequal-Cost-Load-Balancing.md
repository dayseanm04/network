## 🎯 Goal

In this task, I will configure **R1** to perform **unequal-cost load balancing** for traffic going to the **192.168.4.0/24** 
network behind R4.
EIGRP normally load-balances only over **equal-cost** paths. By using the **variance** command, I can also use
**feasible unequal-cost paths** and share the traffic over multiple links.


## 🔍 1️⃣ Verify Current Paths to 192.168.4.0/24

### 1️⃣ Enter privileged EXEC mode

```bash
enable
```

### 2️⃣ Check the current route to 192.168.4.0/24
```bash
show ip route eigrp
```

**Expected output ✅:**

- You should see one EIGRP route (D) to 192.168.4.0/24 using the best metric.
- Right now, R1 is not doing unequal-cost load balancing.

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Configure Variance on R1


### 1️⃣ Enter global configuration mode

```bash
conf t
```

### 2️⃣ Enter router eigrp 100

```bash
router eigrp 100
```

### 3️⃣ Configure variance

```bash
variance 2
end
```

**Note: The value 2 tells EIGRP to consider any feasible path with a metric up to 2× the successor’s metric as a candidate for load balancing.**


## 📊 3️⃣ Verify Unequal-Cost Load Balancing

```bash
show ip route eigrp
```

**Expected output ✅:**
