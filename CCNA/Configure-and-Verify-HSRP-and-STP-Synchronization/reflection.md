# 🧠 Reflection – Configure and Verify HSRP and STP Synchronization

## 📌 Lab Summary

In this lab, I configured **HSRP and STP synchronization** across multiple VLANs to ensure efficient traffic flow in a redundant LAN. By aligning the **HSRP Active gateway** with the **STP root bridge** on a per-VLAN basis, I was able to control both Layer 2 and Layer 3 forwarding behavior.
