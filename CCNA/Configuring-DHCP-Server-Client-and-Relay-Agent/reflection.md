# 📝 Reflection – Configuring DHCP Server, Client, and Relay Agent Lab

## 📘 Lab Summary
- In this lab, I configured **DHCP services across multiple networks** using routers and PCs.
- I set up **R2 as a centralized DHCP server** with multiple DHCP pools.
- I configured **R1 as both a DHCP client and a DHCP relay agent**, allowing DHCP to work across different subnets.
- Finally, I verified that **PC1 and PC2 successfully obtained IP addresses** from the DHCP server.
