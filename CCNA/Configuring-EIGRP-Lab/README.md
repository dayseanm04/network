# 🚀 Configuring EIGRP Lab

This lab focuses on configuring Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol [EIGRP] across four routers.
I will configure hostnames, interfaces, loopbacks, routing, passive interfaces, and unequal-cost load balancing. 
The goal is to understand how EIGRP forms adjacencies, advertises networks, and selects routes based on metrics.
