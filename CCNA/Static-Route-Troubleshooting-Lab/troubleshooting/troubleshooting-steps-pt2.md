# üîÅ Troubleshooting Steps: Part 2

## üéØ Objective
In this section, the goal is to **identify and fix the routing loop** occurring between **R1** and **R2** after the first static route correction on R1.  
The loop prevented packets from reaching R3, beacause the traffic was bouncing repeatedly between R1 and R2.
