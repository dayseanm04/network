# 🛰️ CDP and LLDP Configuration and Verification LAB

## 📌 Summary
This lab focuses on **network device discovery** using **CDP** and **LLDP**. I will use CDP to identify neighboring devices and fill in missing topology details (IP addresses and interface IDs). Then I will harden the network by disabling CDP where appropriate and enabling LLDP for standardized device discovery.

## Topology For Reference
