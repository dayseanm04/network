# 🌍 Task 4 - Enable Remote Syslog Logging to SRV1 (Debugging Level)

## 🎯 Goal
In this task, I will configure **R1** to send syslog messages to the **Syslog Server (SRV1)** and set the logging level to **debugging**.  

This simulates a real enterprise setup where logs are centralized on a server for monitoring and troubleshooting.
