# Configuring Standard ACL Lab Reflection.

## 📝 Summary
In this lab, I configured **standard Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to control traffic between multiple networks while maintaining overall network connectivity.  
Before applying any ACLs, I first configured **OSPF** to ensure full communication between PCs and servers.  
I implemented several standard ACL policies to selectively permit or deny traffic based on **source IP addresses**.
