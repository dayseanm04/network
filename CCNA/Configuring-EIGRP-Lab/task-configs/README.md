# 📁 Task-Config – Configuring EIGRP Lab

This folder contains all task-specific configuration guides for the **Configuring EIGRP Lab**.  
Use these task files to complete the lab in order and understand how EIGRP operates across multiple routers.

## 📘 Navigation

| Task File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Task1-Configure-Hostnames-and-IPs.md** | 🖧 Configure router hostnames, assign interface IP addresses, and bring interfaces up. |
| **Task2-Configure-Router-Loopback-Interfaces.md** | 🔁 Create Loopback0 on each router with unique /32 addresses (1.1.1.1–4.4.4.4). |
| **Task3-Configure-EIGRP-on-All-Routers.md** | 🔄 Enable EIGRP AS 100, disable auto-summary, and configure passive interfaces. |
| **Task4-Configure-Unequal-Cost-Load-Balancing.md** | ⚖️ Configure EIGRP variance on R1 to allow unequal-cost load balancing toward 192.168.4.0/24. |


## 🧩 How to Use This Folder

1. **Start with Task 1** to configure all router hostnames and IP addressing.  
2. **Continue with Task 2** configure loopback interfaces.  
3. **Move to Task 3** to configure EIGRP across the entire topology.  
4. **Finish with Task 4** to enable unequal-cost load balancing on R1 using EIGRP variance.  

Each file includes commands, explanations, and verification steps to help you understand EIGRP.
