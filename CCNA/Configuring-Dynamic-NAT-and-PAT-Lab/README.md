# 🌍 Configuring Dynamic NAT and PAT Lab

## 📘 Lab Overview
In this lab, I will configure **Dynamic NAT** and **Port Address Translation (PAT)** to allow multiple internal hosts to access the internet. The lab demonstrates the limitations of Dynamic NAT when the public IP pool is exhausted and how **PAT solves this problem by allowing many devices to share a single public IP address**.
