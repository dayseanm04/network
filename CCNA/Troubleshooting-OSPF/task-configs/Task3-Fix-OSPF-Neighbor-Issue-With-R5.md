# Task3 Fix OSPF Neighbor Issue With R5.md 🔄🤝

## 🎯 Goal
R2 and R4 will not become OSPF neighbors with **R5**.  
Troubleshoot why the adjacency is failing and fix the issue so R5 forms neighbors successfully.

## Topology For Reference

## 🧪 Step-by-Step: Confirm the Neighbor Problem

### 1️⃣ On R2: Check OSPF neighbors

```bash
enable
show ip ospf neighbor
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="864" height="119" alt="T3-R2-show-ospf-neighbor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aed325e7-4fdc-4a67-82f0-871ae782fa14" />

**Note:** R2 and R4 are neighbors

### 2️⃣ On R4: Check OSPF neighbors

```bash
enable
show ip ospf neighbor
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="879" height="122" alt="T3-R4-show-ospf-neighbor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1ce5c8c-16d6-46d6-887e-43b273a15ae9" />

**Note:** R4 and R2 are neighbors

### 3️⃣ On R5: Check OSPF neighbors

```bash
enable
show ip ospf neighbor
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="636" height="59" alt="T3-R5-show-ospf-neighbor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0eee28a-ab52-435c-962c-fd111bce19ff" />

**Note:** R5 dosent have any neighbors

## 🔎 Step-by-Step: Check the Shared Network Interface

### 4️⃣ On R2: Check OSPF settings on G0/0

```bash
show ip ospf interface g0/0
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="797" height="313" alt="T3-R2-show-g00-int" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badaaded-b6fc-44b2-83b4-9bb5eccabfa1" />

**Note:** R2 G0/0 interface hello timer is 10 and its dead timer is 40

### 5️⃣ On R4: Check OSPF settings on G0/0

```bash
show ip ospf interface g0/0
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="811" height="315" alt="T3-R4-show-g00-int" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd01197d-3ba8-4458-89ac-ccbf26288719" />

**Note:** R4 G0/0 interface hello timer is 10 and its dead timer is 40

### 6️⃣ On R5: Check OSPF settings on G0/0

```bash
show ip ospf interface g0/0
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="748" height="296" alt="T3-R5-show-g00-int" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/547bd16d-4547-43de-b66f-b59cf5f01bd6" />

**Note:** R5 G0/0 interface hello timer is 5 and its dead timer is 20 which is different for R4 and R2 hello and dead timers.

**The do not match! thats why R5 isnt ospf neighbors with R2 and R4**


## 🛠️ Fix: Reset R5 Hello/Dead Timers to Default

### 7️⃣ Enter Global config mode:

```bash
enable
configure terminal
```

### 8️⃣ Enter the G0/0 interface

```bash
interface g0/0
```

### 9️⃣ Remove the custom Hello interval (restore default)

```bash
no ip ospf hello-interval
```

♦️ Wait for a couple of seconds ♦️

## ✅ Verify the Fix

### 1️⃣On R5: Check neighbors

```bash
do show ip ospf neighbor
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="855" height="117" alt="T3-R5-is-neighbors" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8456161e-99bc-4cfd-ad83-e1abc5804fb3" />

R5 became ospf neighbors with R4 and R2

### ♦️ View R5 Routing table in Privileged EXEC mode

```bash
show ip route
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="814" height="421" alt="T3-R5-rt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c42a9121-85cb-4d07-a6b6-e3f44b04adce" />

**Note:** The 10.0.2.0/24 route was learned on R5 via OSPF

### ♦️ View R2 Routing table in Privileged EXEC mode

```bash
show ip route
```

**Expected Output ✅:**

<img width="805" height="390" alt="T3-R2-rt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2743ab6-9d93-4a79-8b69-5b0c771dda19" />
