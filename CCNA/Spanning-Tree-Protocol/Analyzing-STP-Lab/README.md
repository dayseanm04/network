## 📘 Overview
This lab focuses on **analyzing the operation of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** within a switched network topology. STP prevents switching loops and ensures a single active path between switches by electing a **Root Bridge** and placing redundant links into a **blocking** state.

Through this lab, I determined which switch became the **Root Bridge**, identified the **Root Port, Designated and Non Designated ports** of each switch, and analyzed **root path costs** between switches.
