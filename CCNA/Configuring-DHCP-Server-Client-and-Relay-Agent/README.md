# 📡 Configuring DHCP Server, Client, and Relay Agent Lab

## 📘 Lab Overview
In this lab, I will configure **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**. The lab demonstrates how a router can function as a **DHCP server**, a **DHCP client**, and how a **DHCP relay agent** is used to forward DHCP requests across different subnets.

This setup reflects real-world enterprise networks where centralized DHCP servers provide IP addresses to multiple remote networks.
