# 🧠 Reflection – Configure and Verify Dynamic ARP Inspection

## 📌 Lab Summary
In this lab, I configured **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** to protect the network from **ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks**. The lab required configuring a DHCP server and enabling **DHCP Snooping**, which provides the trusted IP-to-MAC bindings that DAI relies on.

After the prerequisites were in place, DAI was enabled on the switches and additional validation checks were applied to ensure only legitimate ARP traffic was allowed.
