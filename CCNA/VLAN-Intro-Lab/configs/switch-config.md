## ‚öôÔ∏è VLAN Configuration Steps

## Step 1: Enter Global Configuration Mode
```bash
enable
configure terminal
```

## Step 2: Create VLANs
```bash
vlan 10
 name Engineering
exit

vlan 20
 name HR
exit

vlan 30
 name Sales
exit
```

## Step 3: Assign Ports to VLANs

### Assign VLAN 10 to the ports connected to PCs in VLAN 10 and router interface G0/0.

```bash
interface range g0/1, f3/1, f4/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
exit
```

### Assign VLAN 20 to the ports connected to PCs in VLAN 20 and router interface G0/1.

```bash
interface range g1/1, f5/1, f6/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
exit
```

### Assign VLAN 30 to the ports connected to PCs in VLAN 30 and router interface G0/2.

```bash
interface range g2/1, f7/1, f8/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 30
exit
```

## üîé Verification: After completing the configuration, verify VLAN creation and port assignments.
### Check VLANs

**Expected Output**
- You should see VLAN 10 (Engineering), VLAN 20 (HR), and VLAN 30 (Sales).
- You should also see the ports for the VLANs.
