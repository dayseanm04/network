# 🔐 Configure and Verify Switch Port Security

## 📌 Summary
This lab focuses on **securing switch interfaces using Port Security**.  

Port Security limits which **MAC addresses** are allowed on a switch port and defines what action the switch should take when a violation occurs.

In this lab, I configured different **port security policies** on two switches to compare how **shutdown** and **restrict** violation modes behave.  
Violations are intentionally triggered and observed to understand how switches respond in real network scenarios.
