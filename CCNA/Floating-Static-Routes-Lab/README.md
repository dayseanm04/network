# 🌐 Floating Static Routes Lab

This lab focuses on how floating static routes provide backup connectivity when a primary OSPF route fails. Enterprise A uses OSPF between R1 and R2, and the goal is to ensure PC1 can still reach SRV1 even if the direct link between the R1 & R2 goes down. The lab walks through verifying routing behavior, configuring backup floating static routes, and testing failover.
