# 🧠 Reflection – Upgrade Cisco IOS Using TFTP and FTP

## 📌 Summary

In this lab, I upgraded the **Cisco IOS** on two routers using **TFTP** and **FTP**. I first configured IP addressing and routing to ensure full connectivity, then transferred a new IOS image from a server to each router. After the transfer, I updated the boot settings, reloaded the routers, verified the new IOS version, and cleaned up old IOS files from flash memory.
