# 🏛️ Task 2: Configure Primary & Secondary Root Bridges (PVST+)

**Objective:** Configure SW1 and SW2 so that each switch becomes the **primary** and **secondary** root bridge for different VLANs. This creates **load balancing** across VLAN 1 and VLAN 2.

---

## 🎯 Goal
- SW1 → **Primary Root for VLAN 1**, **Secondary Root for VLAN 2**  
- SW2 → **Primary Root for VLAN 2**, **Secondary Root for VLAN 1**

This allows traffic for different VLANs to take different paths. 🔀
