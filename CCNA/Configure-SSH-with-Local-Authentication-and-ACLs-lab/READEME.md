# 🔐 Configure SSH with Local Authentication and ACLs Lab

## 📌 Lab Overview
In this lab, I configured **secure remote management using SSH** on a newly added access switch (**SW2**).  
The lab begins with **initial switch setup via the console**, then I applied **local authentication**, and the I finally enabled **SSH-only remote access** restricted by an **access control list (ACL)**.

This configuration reflects real-world best practices for **secure device management**, replacing insecure protocols like Telnet with **encrypted SSH access**.
