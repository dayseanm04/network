# task-config README 📁

## Purpose 🎯
This folder contains all three configuration tasks for the Rapid-STP lab.
Each file documents the steps, calculations, and CLI verification for the
RSTP topology.


## Task 1: Identify the Root Bridge 🔍

- Determine which switch is the Root Bridge.
- Use the CLI to check the port role/state of every interface on the root.
- Identify anything unusual compared to classic STP.
- Explain why the behavior occurs (collision domains, hubs, backup ports).  


## Task 2: Determine Port Roles & States 🔌

- Without using the CLI, predict the port role/state for each switch.
- Calculate RSTP root path costs and apply tie-breaker rules.


## Task 3: Configure RSTP Link Types 🔗

- Manually configure the correct RSTP link type on every interface.
- Determine the correct link type for SW1 F0/24 and explain why.
