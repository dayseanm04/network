# 🛠️ Task 1 – Configure Access Ports for Data and Voice VLANs

## 📌 Objective

Configure the **access switch ports** so they can carry **both data and voice traffic** using:
- A **Data VLAN** for PCs
- A **Voice VLAN** for IP Phones

This allows a **PC and an IP phone to share the same physical switch port** while keeping their traffic logically separated.
