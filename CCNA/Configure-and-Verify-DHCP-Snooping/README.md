# 🛡️ Configure and Verify DHCP Snooping

## 📌 Summary

This lab focuses on **securing DHCP operations using DHCP Snooping**.  
DHCP Snooping helps protect the network from **rogue DHCP servers** by controlling which switch ports are allowed to send DHCP server messages.

In this lab, I configure R1 as a **legitimate DHCP server**, i enabled DHCP Snooping on switches, and I test client behavior to observe how **trusted and untrusted ports** affect DHCP traffic.
