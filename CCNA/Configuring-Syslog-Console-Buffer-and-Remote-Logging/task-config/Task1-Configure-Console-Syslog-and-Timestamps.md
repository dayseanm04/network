# 🖥️ Task 1 - Configure Console Syslog, Severity Levels, and Timestamps

## 🎯 Goal
In this task, I will connect to **R1 via the console**, generate **syslog messages** by shutting down and re-enabling an interface, identify the **severity level** of those messages, and enable **timestamps** for logging.

This task demonstrates how **console logging works by default** on Cisco routers and how syslog messages are generated during interface state changes.
