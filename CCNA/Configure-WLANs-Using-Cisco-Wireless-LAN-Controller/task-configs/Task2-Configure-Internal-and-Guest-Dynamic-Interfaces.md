# 🔧 Task2 Configure Internal and Guest Dynamic Interfaces

## 📌 Objective

Create **dynamic interfaces** on **WLC1** for:
-  **Internal WLAN**
- **Guest WLAN**

## 🧠 Simple Explanation

On a Cisco WLC:
- A **WLAN (SSID)** must be mapped to an **interface**
- A **dynamic interface** represents a VLAN/subnet (ex: Internal vs Guest)
- When a client connects to an SSID, the WLC places the client into the **VLAN/subnet** linked to that interface
