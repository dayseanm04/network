# 🔐 Configuring Extended ACLs Lab

## 📘 Lab Overview
In this lab, I configured extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enforce **specific security policies** between internal networks and servers.  
Extended ACLs are used because they allow filtering based on **source IP, destination IP, protocol, and service ports**, providing more precise traffic control than standard ACLs.

This lab focuses on applying ACLs **close to the source** and verifying that only the intended traffic is blocked while all other traffic is permitted.
