# ⏱️ Configuring NTP (Network Time Protocol)

## 📌 Lab Overview
In this lab, I configured **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** to ensure consistent and accurate time synchronization across multiple routers.  

Accurate time is critical for **logs, troubleshooting, authentication, and security auditing** in real-world networks.

This lab covers **manual clock configuration**, **time zones**, **external NTP servers**, **NTP master configuration**, **authentication**, and **hardware calendar updates** using Cisco Packet Tracer.
